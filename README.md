### About Repo

The library only contains the parts necessary for
training and testing the YOLOv8 model which will be
used as part of a trading card sorting system.

### Image References
All Magic: the Gathering card images were taken from 
`scryfall.com` database and all Yu-Gi-Oh! card images
were taken from `yugioh.fandom.com`.

### Model Weights
Unfortunately the model weights were too large to
upload to GitHub. If you'd like to download the
`best.pt` file for the 40 epoch mode, please visit
